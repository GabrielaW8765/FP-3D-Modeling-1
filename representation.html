  <h1> Categories </h1>
  <p> 3D models can be divided into two categories. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Solid – These models define the volume of the object they represent (like a rock). Solid models are mostly used for engineering and medical simulations, and are usually built with constructive solid geometry </li>
    <li> Shell or boundary – These models represent the surface, i.e. the boundary of the object, not its volume (like an infinitesimally thin eggshell). Almost all visual models used in games and film are shell models. </li>
  </ul>
